%% The Blackjack Troll
% Software Design Project
% Description: The following program is a game titled The Blackjack Troll.
% The game is a spin off of the classic card game. It plays the same as the
% classic game but adds a story element centered around a troll who hides
% under a bridge and doesn't allow anyone to pass unless they play a game
% of blackjack.

%prints a welcome message

%establishes player coin count

%creates a variable that dictates whether to print final scores depending
%on if user decides to play
playCount = 0;

%prints feedback is user does not want to play
if (playChoice==quit || playChoice==quit2)
