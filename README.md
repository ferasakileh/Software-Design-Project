# Software-Design-Project

The following projects have all been coded in MATLAB. 

We are students at the Ohio State University studying engineering. We have taken it
upon ourselves to create a simple game that will create relief after long hours of 
studying and doing homework. We have worked hard this year to refine our skills to 
release a unique version of blackjack. This game mainly is open to all people but it 
was made specifically for high school and college students who always want to find time 
to stress out. It is not a usual Blackjack that you know but a twist has been made to it
by including a storyline that will add more fun for players. This game will be an interesting
casual game for anytime you want to clear your mind and relax after long days of stress and 
hard work. It will provide a new look from the original game and is free to play when you 
download it.

The game is a spin off of the classic card game. It plays the same as the classic game but 
adds a story element centered around a troll who hides under a bridge and doesn’t allow anyone 
to pass unless they play a game of blackjack. The rules of the game are very simple. As a player, 
your goal is to reach exactly 21. In case reaching a number less than 21, you have the choice 
to take a new card or we reveal the winner. However, if you reach a number greater than 21 
then you immediately lose the game, and whoever is closer to 21 wins. At each round, players 
place their bet with coins they actually have in this game. Be sure you cannot bet negative 
coins! If the troll wins, the player will have to give up the coins and hence cannot cross 
the bridge. Whereas, if the player wins, then he/she will cross the bridge and keep the coins. 
However, if there seems to be a tie, then you must give up your bet but you may also cross 
the bridge. After finishing the round, the player has the choice to play again.


The coding of the The Blackjack Troll is entirely done in Matlab. The program starts by printing
a welcome message and prompts the player for a name. The program then asks the user if they
want to play. The program uses the input function in Matlab to gather this information and
will continue to use the input function any time the program needs information from the user.
After the user decides they would like to play, a series of print statements will print revealing
the story element of the game. The code will print a few lines and then prompt the user to enter
any key to move on and will print the next few lines of the story. After that is done the program
will let the user know how many coins they have then the program will prompt them for the 
amount of coins they want to bet. The logic of the code will only let them bet an amount 
they have and will print out an error message if the amount exceeds what they have, is negative, 
or if they attempt to bet 0 coins. After betting, the user will be given two cards and the 
system will print the sum of their cards. After the sum is printed, the program will ask 
the user if they want another card or if they want to reveal their hand. The program will 
continue to ask until the user chooses to reveal the cards. Once the user chooses to reveal 
the cards, the cards will be revealed. The total of the troll’s cards and the player’s cards 
will be revealed. Depending on whoever’s hand is closer to 21, the program will print out a 
winner’s message. After each round the program will ask the user if they want to play again. 
If they say yes, a new round will start. If they say no, the game will end and print final 
scores, a congratulations message, and a thank you message. The program employs the use of 
vectors, while loops, for loops, and if statements to create a unique experience every time.

While writing the first draft of our code we worked in sections. We progressed by completing a 
section, making sure the code was running successfully, and continuing onto the next section 
until the code was complete. We then repeated this process for our whole code while making 
changes and perfecting the code. During this process, we would test all our code and make sure 
it is coming together and functioning properly. While our process was somewhat smooth, we faced 
many obstacles with a few while loops, getting the cards detailed in-game, and making the dialogue 
creative and interesting for the players. We overcame our while loop issues through trial and error 
and repetition. As for creating creative dialogue between the AI and the player we took inspiration 
from the feedback of players. During the testing of our game, we made sure each loop containing large 
amounts of code were properly testing for every single input possible. We repeatedly ran the code and 
put every single appropriate input to test the result. Additionally, once we made sure the code was 
running perfectly, we asked people we interviewed to test out the game for us and give us feedback. We 
took their feedback into consideration and made changes we sought fit.

The Blackjack Troll game was built so that anybody may play it for free. The game is modeled on the classic 
Blackjack card game, but with a twist. It was made with Matlab, and the game is played by requesting the 
user to enter specific letters. Blackjack troll is a traditional game with simple rules and is a fun way 
to spend the time since it mimics the scenario of the troll on the bridge. Because Blackjack is not an easy 
game to write, making a simple plan and executing a test trial every now and then would be quite beneficial. 
Overall, the team was thrilled at the end when the game code worked well.
